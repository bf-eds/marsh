Pure C Graphic Library Platform Independent


You need to build cpputest (not install) in order to build and run
marsh.

	1) unzip cpputest-3.4.zip
	2) cd cpputest-3.4
	3) ./configure
	4) make

To build marsh:
	
	1) cd marsh
	2) make all

You will have two executables:
	- marsh-tests runs the CppUTest tests
	- marsh-simu runs a linux example
